# HuKit – Hückel Molecular Orbital Toolkit

**Stable version:** v1.0.0  
**Last Release date:** 24 November 2025  

---

## Overview
HuKit is software dedicated to the analysis of conjugated molecular systems based on the Hückel model.  
It allows the calculation and visualization of molecular orbitals, including molecules containing heteroatoms, and provides the option to choose different electronic configurations (ground, ionized, or excited states).

## Key Features
- **Molecule loading**
  - Support for `.mol` formats and SMILES strings.
  - Interactive visualization of the molecular structure.
- **Hückel orbital calculation**
  - Implementation of the standard Hückel model.
  - Handling of heteroatoms using tabulated parameters.
  - Calculation of orbital energies and occupations according to the chosen configuration.
- **Results visualization**
  - Energy diagram of molecular orbitals.
  - Graphical visualization of molecular orbitals.
  - Option to display partial charges and bond orders.
- **Data export**
  - Ability to save results in a readable format.
